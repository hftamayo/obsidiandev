# Project Data Sheet

## Overview
Spring Boot-based Todo application containerized with Docker, using MySQL for persistence and JWT for authentication.

## Technical Specifications

### Stack
- **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Deployment**: Docker, multi-platform support (AMD64/ARM64)
- **Build Tool**: Maven

### Design Patterns
1. **MVC Pattern**
   - Separation of concerns between Model, View, and Controller
   - RESTful API design principles

2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Data access abstraction through JPA repositories
   - Clean separation between data access and business logic

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Spring's IoC container for managing dependencies
   - Constructor-based injection for services

4. **DTO Pattern**
   - Data Transfer Objects for API request/response
   - Protects entity models from direct exposure

5. **Builder Pattern**
   - Likely used for complex object creation (JWT tokens, responses)

6. **Factory Pattern**
   - Service instantiation through Spring's component factory

### Key Features
- RESTful API endpoints for Todo management
- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Multi-environment configuration (dev, docker, production)
- Data seeding capabilities (configurable)
- Hibernate ORM with MySQL dialect
- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Volume mounting for configuration

### Security
- JWT token authentication
- Password encryption
- Configurable token expiration (8 hours default)
- Separate user roles (admin, supervisor, users)

### Configuration
- Environment-specific properties files
- Externalized configuration through volume mounting
- Configurable database connection
- Configurable logging levels

## Future Improvements

### Architectural Improvements
1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Split into smaller, focused services (auth, todo, user management)
   - API Gateway for request routing and cross-cutting concerns

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Implement message brokers (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for asynchronous processing
   - Event sourcing for better audit trails and state recovery

3. **CQRS Pattern**
   - Separate read and write operations for better scalability
   - Optimized read models for query performance

4. **Domain-Driven Design**
   - Stronger domain model with bounded contexts
   - More explicit aggregates and value objects

5. **Hexagonal Architecture**
   - Ports and adapters to decouple business logic from infrastructure
   - Better testability and flexibility for storage options

6. **Infrastructure**
   - Kubernetes deployment for orchestration
   - Service mesh for inter-service communication
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Centralized logging and monitoring (ELK stack)
   - Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin)

7. **Resilience Patterns**
   - Circuit breakers for fault tolerance
   - Rate limiting
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
   - No monitoring implementation
