# NodeTodo API Technical Data Sheet

## Project Overview
A RESTful API for a Todo application built with modern Node.js practices, featuring comprehensive testing, user authentication, and role-based access control.

## Technology Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| **Core Runtime** | Node.js â‰¥20.11.0 |
| **Language** | TypeScript |
| **Framework** | Express.js |
| **Database** | MongoDB with Mongoose |
| **Authentication** | JWT-based auth with role-based access control |
| **Testing** | Jest with comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests |
| **API Design** | RESTful API with structured response formatting |
| **Code Quality** | ESLint, consistent error handling patterns |

## API Features

- **Todo Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete todos
- **User Management**: User authentication and authorization
- **Role Management**: Role-based access control with granular permissions
- **Health Checks**: API self-monitoring endpoints

## Architectural Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of routes, controllers, and services
- **Path Aliasing**: Type-safe import aliases for better code organization
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E test suites
- **Environment Support**: Development and production environment configurations
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error management across the application
- **Database Seeding**: Automated data seeding for development and testing

## Design Patterns

- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation of Models (data), Controllers (request handling), and Views (response formatting)
- **Repository Pattern**: Service layer abstracts database operations from business logic
- **Dependency Injection**: Controllers receive services as dependencies for better testability
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating test mocks and configuration objects
- **Middleware Pattern**: Composable request processing pipeline for authentication, logging, and error handling
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single database connection shared across the application
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different response strategies based on HTTP status codes
- **Adapter Pattern**: Standardized response format across different API endpoints
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-based error logging and request monitoring

## Security Features

- CORS protection
- Cookie parsing and security
- Secure authentication flow
- Role-based access control
- Input validation
- Proper error handling without leaking sensitive information

## Development Tooling

- Hot reloading for development
- Path aliases for cleaner imports
- Comprehensive testing scripts
- Environment-specific configurations
- Custom seed data for development

## Deployment & Operations

- Production-ready configuration
- Environment variable management
- Structured logging
- Health check endpoints
- Clean error handling

## Future Improvements

* **GraphQL Integration** - Implement GraphQL alongside REST to enable more flexible querying capabilities, reduce over-fetching, and provide a more efficient API interface for complex data requirements.

* **Microservices Architecture** - Consider breaking down the monolithic application into domain-specific microservices (users, todos, roles) for better scalability, team autonomy, and maintainability.

* **Caching Layer** - Implement Redis or another caching solution to improve performance for frequently accessed data and reduce database load.

* **Event-Driven Architecture** - Introduce message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous processing and better service decoupling.

* **Observability Stack** - Integrate Prometheus, Grafana, and distributed tracing to gain deeper insights into application performance and behavior.

* **Enhanced Authentication** - Extend the authentication system to support OAuth/OpenID Connect for third-party authentication providers.

* **API Gateway** - Implement an API gateway to handle cross-cutting concerns like rate limiting, request routing, and API versioning.

* **CQRS Pattern** - Separate read and write operations for more complex domains, potentially with different data models optimized for each purpose.

* **Containerization** - Dockerize the application and implement Kubernetes for orchestration to improve deployment consistency and scalability.

* **Domain-Driven Design** - Refactor the code structure to align more closely with business domains, emphasizing ubiquitous language and bounded contexts.

* **Improved Error Handling** - Implement a more robust error handling framework with custom error classes and centralized logging.

* **CI/CD Pipeline** - Establish a comprehensive CI/CD workflow with automated testing, quality gates, and deployment across environments.

* **Serverless Functions** - Consider moving appropriate parts of the application to serverless architecture for improved scalability and cost efficiency.
