Great question! Let me help you prioritize based on your current project state and best practices:

## **My Recommendation: Unit Testing First! 🧪**

Here's why this is the optimal next move:

### **Strong Arguments for Unit Testing:**

#### **1. Perfect Timing** ⏰
- ✅ **Stable authentication system** - Core flows are working
- ✅ **Recent refactoring** - You just converted routes to modals, consolidated containers
- ✅ **Fresh in memory** - Logic is still fresh, easier to write tests
- ✅ **Clean architecture** - Container-Presenter pattern is very testable

#### **2. Risk Mitigation** 🛡️
- **Prevent regressions** - Protect your hard work during future changes
- **API integration safety** - When you fix the Node API, tests will catch any breaking changes
- **Refactoring confidence** - Future improvements won't break existing functionality

#### **3. Development Velocity** 🚀
- **Faster debugging** - Tests will pinpoint issues quickly
- **Documentation** - Tests serve as living documentation of expected behavior
- **Confidence** - You'll know immediately if changes break something

### **What to Test (Priority Order):**

#### **High Priority:**
1. **Authentication hooks** (`useAuthState`, `useAuthMutations`)
2. **Modal state management** (`useModalState`)
3. **TaskBoard hooks** (`useTaskBoard`) - especially after API fix
4. **Error handling** flows

#### **Medium Priority:**
1. **Component integration** (Login/Signup/Logout flows)
2. **Route protection** (AuthGuard)
3. **API client** functions

### **Why NOT Reports Module Yet:**
- 🚧 **API dependency** - You'll likely hit the same API issues
- 📈 **Feature complexity** - Reports are typically complex, better with solid test foundation
- 🔄 **Parallel work** - You can design report wireframes while writing tests

### **Suggested Timeline:**
```
Week 1-2: Core unit tests (auth, modals, hooks)
Week 3: API fixes + integration tests  
Week 4+: Reports module (with TDD approach)
```

### **Benefits for Reports Module:**
- **TDD approach** - Write tests first, then implement reports
- **Proven patterns** - Apply tested authentication/modal patterns
- **Stable foundation** - Build on tested, reliable base

## **Bottom Line:**
**Unit testing now = Future you will thank present you!** 🙏

The authentication and modal systems you just built are the **foundation** for everything else. Testing them now protects all future work, including the reports module.

What do you think? Does this approach align with your project timeline and goals?
