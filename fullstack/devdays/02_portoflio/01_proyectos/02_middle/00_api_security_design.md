ðŸ”‘ API Security Tips:  
- Start with the Basics: Secure your endpoints. Ensure they are not publicly accessible unless needed.  
- Use HTTPS: Encryption isnâ€™t just for online shoppingâ€”make it standard for your APIs.  
  
ðŸ”‘ Issue Multiple Pairs of Keys:  
- One key is never enough. Implement multiple keys for different environments (development, staging, production).  
- Rotate keys regularly. Itâ€™s a simple step that can drastically improve your security posture.  
  
ðŸ”‘ HTTP Methods:  
- Understand the power of verbs.  
- GET for retrieval, POST for creation, and make sure to restrict methods where not needed.  
- Use PUT and DELETE carefullyâ€”only expose when absolutely necessary.  
  
ðŸ”‘ Generate Signature:  
- Implement a request signature. It acts like a digital fingerprint, confirming the origin of the request.  
- Always include a timestamp. This prevents replay attacks.  
  
ðŸ”‘ Send Requests:  
- Sanitize inputs. Never trust incoming data.  
- Implement rate limiting to combat excessive requests and potential DDoS attacks.
