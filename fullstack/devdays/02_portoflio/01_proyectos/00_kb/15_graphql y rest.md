**1. Backoffice ecommerce → GraphQL** ✅
Perfect choice. Admins need complex queries like "get all orders from last month with customer details, product info, and payment status" - exactly what GraphQL excels at.

**2. Point of Sale → REST** ✅ 
Smart call. POS systems need fast, predictable operations: scan item, add to cart, process payment. REST's simplicity and speed are ideal here. Plus, POS systems often work offline and REST caches better.

**3. Account System → REST** ✅
Makes sense. User management is typically straightforward CRUD operations. Login, create user, update profile, reset password - all map cleanly to REST endpoints.

**4. HR System → REST** ✅
Good thinking. HR workflows are usually process-driven and predictable. Employee records, payroll, time tracking - these map well to REST resources.

**5. Payment System → REST** ✅
Absolutely right. Payment APIs need to be simple, reliable, and fast. You want minimal complexity when money is involved. REST's predictability is a feature here.

Your logic about team focus vs. complex data requirements is spot on. The backoffice users need flexible querying across multiple entities, while the other systems have more focused, predictable access patterns.

Only consideration: if projects 2-5 need to integrate with each other frequently, you might consider a GraphQL gateway that federates multiple REST services, but that's probably overkill unless you have that specific need.

## Ejemplos de Proyectos que incluyen GraphQL

**Content Management Systems (CMS)**
- Complex nested content structures (articles with authors, categories, comments, related posts)
- Multiple frontends (web, mobile, headless) needing different data shapes
- Publishers wanting flexible content queries

**Social Media Platforms**
- Complex relationships (users, posts, comments, likes, followers, feeds)
- Different views need different data (timeline vs profile vs notifications)
- Real-time features with subscriptions work great

**Analytics/Reporting Dashboards**
- Users need to build custom reports with different metrics
- Complex aggregations across multiple data sources
- Different dashboard widgets need different data slices

**Multi-tenant SaaS Platforms**
- Different customers have different data models or feature sets
- Complex permission systems across organizations/teams
- Flexible integrations with customer systems

**Financial/Banking Applications**
- Complex relationships (accounts, transactions, users, beneficiaries)
- Different client apps need different views of the same data
- Regulatory reporting with flexible query requirements

**Healthcare/Medical Systems**
- Complex patient data (medical history, appointments, prescriptions, providers)
- Different roles (doctors, nurses, admins) need different data access
- Integration with multiple healthcare providers

**Project Management Tools**
- Complex relationships (projects, tasks, users, deadlines, dependencies)
- Different views for different roles (manager vs developer vs client)
- Real-time collaboration features

**Gaming Platforms**
- Complex player stats, achievements, social features
- Different game clients need different data
- Real-time multiplayer features

The common thread is **complex data relationships + multiple clients with different needs**. If you have simple CRUD with predictable access patterns, stick with REST!

## CQRS

Actually, CQRS works great with both REST and GraphQL! The choice to use CQRS should be based on your domain complexity and requirements, not your API style.

**CQRS is about separating read and write models** - it's a pattern that happens _behind_ your API, regardless of whether that API is REST or GraphQL.

**CQRS + REST:**

```
POST /orders (write model)
GET /orders (read model)
PUT /orders/{id} (write model)
GET /orders/analytics (read model)
```

**CQRS + GraphQL:**

```graphql
# Mutations (write model)
mutation createOrder { ... }
mutation updateOrder { ... }

# Queries (read model)  
query getOrders { ... }
query getOrderAnalytics { ... }
```

**When CQRS makes sense (regardless of API choice):**

- **Complex business logic** - writes need validation, reads need optimization
- **Different scaling needs** - many reads, fewer writes
- **Different data shapes** - write model focused on business rules, read model optimized for queries
- **Event sourcing** - commands generate events, queries read projections

**GraphQL actually pairs really well with CQRS:**

- **Mutations** naturally map to commands (write side)
- **Queries** naturally map to read models
- **Subscriptions** work great with event-driven architectures

**Your e-commerce example:**

- Write side: process orders, validate inventory, handle payments
- Read side: product catalogs, user dashboards, analytics
- Works whether you expose it via REST or GraphQL

The decision should be: "Do I have complex enough business logic to justify separate read/write models?" not "Am I using REST or GraphQL?"

Are you thinking about CQRS because of the complexity in your e-commerce domain?
