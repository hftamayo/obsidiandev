# React Query vs Redux for Data Management

Using React Query (or TanStack Query) for server state management is a **modern and recommended approach**, not a legacy one. Here's why:

### Modern Approach Benefits
- Clear separation between client and server state
- Built-in caching and invalidation
- Automatic background updates
- Optimistic updates out of the box
- Request deduplication
- Error handling and retries
- Loading states management

### When to Use Each
**React Query**
- Server state (CRUD operations)
- Data fetching
- Cache management
- API interactions
- Real-time updates

**Redux**
- Global UI state
- Complex client-side state
- Application preferences
- Authentication state
- Feature flags
- Multi-step forms

### Industry Trend
The trend is moving towards specialized tools:
- Server state → React Query/SWR
- Forms → React Hook Form/Formik
- Client state → Redux/Zustand
- Routing → React Router/Wouter

This separation of concerns leads to:
- Better performance
- Easier maintenance
- Clearer code organization
- More predictable data flow

Would you like me to show examples of how this modern approach compares to legacy patterns?
