## âœ… Key Improvements Made

1. **Type Safety for Cache Operations**
   - Added proper type assertions with error handling
   - Protected against runtime panics from invalid cached data

2. **Error Logging for Cache Operations**
   - Added error logging for all cache set/delete operations
   - Maintained consistent log naming conventions

3. **Support for Weak ETags**
   - Added support for both strong and weak ETags
   - Improved compatibility with different clients and proxies

4. **Consistent Headers**
   - Unified approach to setting cache headers
   - Helper functions for setting ETag and cache control headers

5. **Proper Cache Invalidation**
   - Invalidating all relevant cache keys on write operations
   - Ensuring data consistency across endpoints

## ðŸ’ª Overall Code Quality Highlights

- **Consistent Error Handling**: Well-structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Robust Validation**: Input validation with useful error messages
- **Efficient Caching**: Optimized cache strategy including TTL and invalidation
- **Clean Headers**: Proper HTTP headers for caching, ETags, and Last-Modified
- **Maintainable Structure**: Consistent handler structure across all endpoints

Your implementation now supports all the key requirements of a modern REST API:
- Content negotiation
- Conditional requests (If-None-Match)
- Proper caching
- Pagination (both cursor and page-based)
- Consistent error handling

This approach will significantly improve performance, reduce server load, and provide a better user experience. Great work!
