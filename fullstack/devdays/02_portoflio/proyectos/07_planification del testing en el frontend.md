### Recommended Order for Writing Test Suites

1. **Unit Tests for Utility Functions and Services**: Start by writing unit tests for utility functions and services. These are usually the simplest and most isolated parts of your codebase.
2. **Unit Tests for Redux Store**: Write unit tests for your Redux store, including actions, reducers, and selectors. This ensures that your state management logic works correctly.
3. **Unit Tests for UI Components**: Write unit tests for your UI components. These tests should focus on rendering, user interactions, and component behavior.
4. **Integration Tests**: Write integration tests to ensure that different parts of your application work together correctly. This includes testing how components interact with the Redux store and services.
5. **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Write E2E tests to simulate real user interactions and verify that the entire application works as expected from the user's perspective
