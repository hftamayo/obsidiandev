### configuracion de EsLint y Prettier

==por qué necesito estas herramientas:

ESLint and Prettier are essential tools for maintaining code quality and consistency in your project. Here’s why you should consider using them:

### ESLint

1. **Code Quality**: ESLint helps identify and fix problems in your JavaScript/TypeScript code. It enforces coding standards and best practices, which can prevent bugs and improve code readability.
2. **Consistency**: By enforcing a consistent coding style across your project, ESLint makes it easier for multiple developers to work on the same codebase.
3. **Error Prevention**: ESLint can catch common programming errors, such as undefined variables or incorrect use of functions, before they cause runtime issues.
4. **Customizable**: ESLint is highly configurable, allowing you to define your own rules or extend existing ones to fit your project's needs.

### Prettier

1. **Code Formatting**: Prettier automatically formats your code according to a set of rules, ensuring a consistent style throughout your project.
2. **Ease of Use**: By automating code formatting, Prettier saves time and reduces the need for manual formatting, allowing developers to focus on writing code.
3. **Integration**: Prettier integrates well with ESLint, ensuring that both linting and formatting rules are applied consistently.
4. **Readability**: Consistently formatted code is easier to read and understand, which can improve collaboration and reduce the likelihood of errors.

==what about if I have installed in my IDE extensions like prettier, sonarqube, do I still need Eslint and Prettier in my project? I'm thinking in a possible impact in the performance of the application


Even if you have IDE extensions like Prettier and SonarQube, it's still beneficial to include ESLint and Prettier configurations directly in your project. Here’s why:

### Benefits of Including ESLint and Prettier in Your Project

1. **Consistency Across Environments**:
   - **IDE Extensions**: Relying solely on IDE extensions means that only developers using those specific IDEs and extensions will benefit from linting and formatting.
   - **Project Configuration**: Including ESLint and Prettier in your project ensures that all developers, regardless of their IDE, will have consistent linting and formatting rules applied.

2. **Automated CI/CD Integration**:
   - **IDE Extensions**: Extensions work only within the IDE and cannot enforce rules during automated processes.
   - **Project Configuration**: ESLint and Prettier can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically check and enforce code quality and formatting before merging code.

3. **Version Control**:
   - **IDE Extensions**: Extensions may use different versions of ESLint and Prettier, leading to inconsistencies.
   - **Project Configuration**: By specifying versions in your [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_buddyman%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_buddyman/package.json"), you ensure that all developers use the same versions, leading to consistent behavior.

4. **Custom Rules and Plugins**:
   - **IDE Extensions**: May not support all custom rules or plugins you need.
   - **Project Configuration**: Allows you to define custom rules and use specific plugins tailored to your project’s needs.

### Performance Impact

The performance impact of including ESLint and Prettier in your project is minimal and generally only affects the development environment. These tools do not run in the production environment, so they do not impact the performance of the deployed application.

### Recommended Setup

1. **Install ESLint and Prettier**:
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-import eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser
   ```

2. **Configure ESLint (`.eslintrc.js`)**:
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
     extends: [
       'eslint:recommended',
       'plugin:react/recommended',
       'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended',
       'plugin:prettier/recommended',
     ],
     parserOptions: {
       ecmaVersion: 2020,
       sourceType: 'module',
       ecmaFeatures: {
         jsx: true,
       },
     },
     settings: {
       react: {
         version: 'detect',
       },
     },
     rules: {
       'prettier/prettier': 'error',
       'react/react-in-jsx-scope': 'off',
       '@typescript-eslint/explicit-module-boundary-types': 'off',
     },
   };
   ```

3. **Configure Prettier (`.prettierrc`)**:
   ```json
   {
     "semi": true,
     "singleQuote": true,
     "printWidth": 80,
     "tabWidth": 2,
     "trailingComma": "es5",
     "endOfLine": "auto"
   }
   ```

4. **Add ESLint and Prettier scripts to [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_buddyman%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_buddyman/package.json")**:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "vite",
     "build": "vite build",
     "serve": "vite preview",
     "test": "jest",
     "lint": "eslint 'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'",
     "format": "prettier --write 'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx,json,css,md}'"
   }
   ```

### Example Usage

With the configurations in place, you can run the following commands to lint and format your code:

- **Linting**: `npm run lint`
- **Formatting**: `npm run format`

### Conclusion

Including ESLint and Prettier in your project ensures consistent code quality and formatting across all development environments and integrates well with CI/CD pipelines. The performance impact is negligible and only affects the development process, not the production application.

==I'm planning to use a CI/CD pipeline during the development, QA and production stages, will ESLint and Prettier impact the performance of the pipeline? I'm thinking in avoid the duplication of tasks that the CI/CD will run


Using ESLint and Prettier in your CI/CD pipeline is a common practice to ensure code quality and consistency before code is merged or deployed. While they do add some overhead to the pipeline, the impact on performance is generally minimal and the benefits often outweigh the costs. Here’s how you can manage this effectively:

### Benefits of Including ESLint and Prettier in CI/CD

1. **Consistency**: Ensures that all code adheres to the same standards, regardless of the developer's local setup.
2. **Quality Assurance**: Catches potential issues early in the development process, reducing bugs and improving code quality.
3. **Automated Enforcement**: Automatically enforces coding standards and formatting rules, reducing the need for manual code reviews focused on style.

### Minimizing Performance Impact

To minimize the performance impact and avoid duplication of tasks, you can optimize your CI/CD pipeline as follows:

1. **Run ESLint and Prettier Only on Changed Files**: Use tools like `lint-staged` to run ESLint and Prettier only on files that have changed in a commit.
2. **Parallelize Tasks**: Run ESLint and Prettier in parallel with other tasks in your CI/CD pipeline to reduce overall build time.
3. **Cache Dependencies**: Use caching mechanisms provided by your CI/CD service to cache dependencies and speed up subsequent runs.

### Example CI/CD Configuration

Here’s an example of how you might configure a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run ESLint and Prettier:

#### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run ESLint
      run: npm run lint

    - name: Run Prettier
      run: npm run format -- --check

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

### `lint-staged` Configuration

To run ESLint and Prettier only on changed files, you can use `lint-staged`:

1. **Install `lint-staged` and `husky`:**
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev lint-staged husky
   ```

2. **Add `lint-staged` configuration to [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_buddyman%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_buddyman/package.json"):**
   ```json
   "lint-staged": {
     "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
       "eslint --fix",
       "prettier --write"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Configure `husky` to run `lint-staged` on pre-commit:**
   ```sh
   npx husky-init
   npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
   ```

### Example Usage in Development

With `lint-staged` and `husky` configured, ESLint and Prettier will automatically run on changed files before each commit, ensuring code quality without significantly impacting the CI/CD pipeline performance.

### Conclusion

Including ESLint and Prettier in your CI/CD pipeline is beneficial for maintaining code quality and consistency. By optimizing your pipeline to run these tools only on changed files and parallelizing tasks, you can minimize the performance impact and avoid duplication of tasks. This approach ensures that your codebase remains clean and maintainable throughout the development lifecycle.


==and what about Husky:

Husky is a tool that allows you to easily manage Git hooks in your project. Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at certain points in the Git workflow, such as before a commit or push. Here are the benefits of including Husky in your project:

### Benefits of Using Husky

1. **Automated Code Quality Checks**:
   - **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run ESLint, Prettier, and other linters or formatters before code is committed, ensuring that only clean, well-formatted code is added to the repository.
   - **Pre-push Hooks**: Run tests or other checks before code is pushed to the remote repository, preventing broken code from being pushed.

2. **Consistency**:
   - **Enforce Standards**: Ensure that all developers follow the same coding standards and practices by running the same checks automatically.
   - **Reduce Human Error**: Automate repetitive tasks to reduce the likelihood of human error.

3. **Improved Code Quality**:
   - **Catch Issues Early**: Identify and fix issues early in the development process, reducing the time and effort required to address them later.
   - **Maintain Clean Codebase**: Keep the codebase clean and maintainable by enforcing consistent formatting and linting rules.

### Example Configuration

Here’s how you can set up Husky in your project to run ESLint and Prettier before each commit:

1. **Install Husky and lint-staged**:
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev husky lint-staged
   ```

2. **Initialize Husky**:
   ```sh
   npx husky install
   ```

3. **Add a pre-commit hook**:
   ```sh
   npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx lint-staged"
   ```

4. **Configure lint-staged in your [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_buddyman%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_buddyman/package.json")**:
   ```json
   "lint-staged": {
     "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
       "eslint --fix",
       "prettier --write"
     ]
   }
   ```

### Example Usage

With Husky and lint-staged configured, every time you try to commit code, the following will happen:

1. **Pre-commit Hook**: Husky will trigger the pre-commit hook.
2. **Lint-staged**: Lint-staged will run ESLint and Prettier on the staged files.
3. **Commit**: If the linting and formatting pass, the commit will proceed. If there are issues, the commit will be aborted, and you will need to fix the issues before committing again.

### Example Configuration in Action

Given the provided excerpt from [`main.tsx`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_buddyman%2Fsrc%2Fmain.tsx%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_buddyman/src/main.tsx"):

```tsx
import "./index.css";
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./containers/App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

If you try to commit this file and it has linting or formatting issues, Husky and lint-staged will automatically fix them (if possible) or prevent the commit until the issues are resolved.

### Conclusion

Including Husky in your project provides automated enforcement of code quality and consistency, reducing the likelihood of human error and maintaining a clean codebase. It integrates seamlessly with tools like ESLint and Prettier, ensuring that all code committed to the repository adheres to the defined standards. This setup is especially beneficial in a collaborative environment where multiple developers are working on the same codebase.

==I assume Husky is useful in scenarios like GitOps, am I right?

Yes, you are correct. Husky is particularly useful in GitOps scenarios. GitOps is a practice where Git is used as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. In such scenarios, maintaining code quality and consistency is crucial, and Husky can help enforce these standards automatically

==but Husky won't interfer in another approaches such as DevOps, DevSecOps right?

No, Husky will not interfere with other approaches such as DevOps or DevSecOps. In fact, it complements these practices by ensuring code quality and consistency before code is committed or pushed, which aligns well with the principles of DevOps and DevSecOps.

### How Husky Fits into DevOps and DevSecOps

1. **DevOps**:
    
    - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Husky can run linting, formatting, and tests before code is committed, ensuring that only high-quality code enters the CI pipeline.
    - **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: By catching issues early, Husky helps maintain a stable codebase, reducing the likelihood of deployment failures.

2. **DevSecOps**:
    
    - **Security Checks**: Husky can be configured to run security linters or static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint with security plugins) before code is committed, ensuring that security issues are caught early.
    - **Compliance**: Enforcing coding standards and best practices helps maintain compliance with security policies and regulations.


==npx husky install throw this: install command is DEPRECATED

It looks like the `npx husky install` command is deprecated. You can use the new way to set up Husky in your project. Here’s how you can do it:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Husky

1. **Install Husky**:
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev husky
   ```

2. **Initialize Husky**:
   ```sh
   npx husky-init
   ```

   This command will:
   - Create a [`.husky`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_buddyman%2F.husky%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_buddyman/.husky") directory in your project.
   - Set up a pre-commit hook that runs `npm test`.
   - Add a `prepare` script to your [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_buddyman%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_buddyman/package.json") to automatically set up Husky when you install dependencies.

3. **Modify the Pre-commit Hook**:
   - Open the `.husky/pre-commit` file and modify it to run `lint-staged` instead of `npm test`.

   ```sh
   # .husky/pre-commit
   #!/bin/sh
   . "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

   npx lint-staged
   ```

4. **Install `lint-staged`**:
   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev lint-staged
   ```

5. **Configure `lint-staged` in your [`package.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_buddyman%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_buddyman/package.json")**:
   ```json
   "lint-staged": {
     "src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}": [
       "eslint --fix",
       "prettier --write"
     ]
   }
   ```

### Example Configuration

==did I forget to mention this must be a production ready project?==

Setting up a production-ready React.js project involves several steps to ensure code quality, performance, security, and deployment readiness. Here are some additional steps and configurations you might consider:

### Additional Setup for a Production-Ready React.js Project

1. **Build Optimization**:
   - Ensure your build process is optimized for production. Vite, which you are using, already does a good job of this, but make sure you are using the production build command (`vite build`).

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use environment variables to manage different configurations for development and production.
   - Create `.env` and `.env.production` files for environment-specific variables.

3. **Security**:
   - Use security linters and tools to identify and fix potential security issues.
   - Ensure dependencies are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.

4. **Testing**:
   - Ensure you have comprehensive tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests) and that they run as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

5. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**:
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading to improve the performance of your application.

6. **Error Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Integrate error monitoring and logging tools (e.g., Sentry) to track and fix issues in production.

7. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements**:

### Planning for microfrontends:

==I would like to mention the first version of this project would be a monolith but the objective is to migrate to micro frontend architecture, does this affect the current setup? should I add something else?==

Transitioning from a monolith to a micro frontend architecture can have implications on your current setup. Here are some considerations and steps to ensure your project is prepared for this transition:

### Considerations for Micro Frontend Architecture

1. **Modular Codebase**:
   - Ensure your codebase is modular and components are loosely coupled. This will make it easier to split the monolith into smaller, independent micro frontends.

2. **Shared Dependencies**:
   - Identify common dependencies that will be shared across micro frontends. Use a package manager like `npm` or `yarn` to manage these dependencies.

3. **Routing**:
   - Plan your routing strategy. Each micro frontend might have its own routing, and you may need a top-level router to manage navigation between micro frontends.

4. **State Management**:
   - Decide on a state management strategy. You might need a global state management solution or individual state management for each micro frontend.

5. **Build and Deployment**:
   - Plan your build and deployment strategy. Each micro frontend should be independently deployable.

6. **Communication Between Micro Frontends**:
   - Establish a communication mechanism between micro frontends, such as custom events or a shared state.

### Steps to Prepare for Micro Frontend Architecture

1. **Modularize Your Codebase**:
   - Start by organizing your code into modules or packages. Use a tool like `lerna` to manage monorepos if needed.

2. **Use Webpack Module Federation**:
   - Webpack Module Federation is a powerful feature that allows you to load remote modules at runtime. This is particularly useful for micro frontends.

3. **Shared Libraries**:
   - Create shared libraries for common components, utilities, and styles. These can be published as npm packages and consumed by each micro frontend.

4. **Container Application**:
   - Create a container application that will host and orchestrate the micro frontends. This application will handle routing and communication between micro frontends.

### Example Setup with Webpack Module Federation

Here’s an example of how you can set up Webpack Module Federation in your project:

#### `webpack.config.js` for the Container Application

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index',
  mode: 'development',
  devServer: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  output: {
    publicPath: 'http://localhost:3000/',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'container',
      remotes: {
        app1: 'app1@http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js',
        app2: 'app2@http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js',
      },
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './public/index.html',
    }),
  ],
};
```

#### `webpack.config.js` for a Micro Frontend Application

```javascript
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const ModuleFederationPlugin = require('webpack/lib/container/ModuleFederationPlugin');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index',
  mode: 'development',
  devServer: {
    port: 3001,
  },
  output: {
    publicPath: 'http://localhost:3001/',
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx?$/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        exclude: /node_modules/,
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'app1',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './App': './src/App',
      },
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './public/index.html',
    }),
  ],
};
```

### Summary

1. **Modularize Your Codebase**:
   - Organize your code into modules or packages.

2. **Use Webpack Module Federation**:
   - Set up Webpack Module Federation to load remote modules at runtime.

3. **Create Shared Libraries**:
   - Create shared libraries for common components, utilities, and styles.

4. **Container Application**:
   - Create a container application to host and orchestrate the micro frontends.

5. **Plan for Routing and State Management**:
   - Plan your routing and state management strategy for micro frontends.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your project is prepared for the transition from a monolith to a micro frontend architecture. This setup will allow you to develop, build, and deploy each micro frontend independently while maintaining a cohesive user experience.

### ==what about if I'm using Vite for building tool

No, you do not need to install Webpack if you are already using Vite. Vite is a modern build tool that serves a similar purpose to Webpack but is designed to be faster and more efficient, especially for development.

### Key Points:

- **Vite vs. Webpack**: Both Vite and Webpack are build tools, but Vite is optimized for speed and simplicity, particularly in development environments. Vite uses native ES modules in the browser during development and bundles the code for production using Rollup.
  
- **Module Federation**: While Webpack's Module Federation is a powerful feature for micro frontends, Vite has its own ecosystem and plugins that can achieve similar goals. You can look into Vite's plugin ecosystem for solutions tailored to Vite.

### Recommendations:

1. **Stick with Vite**: Since you are already using Vite, continue to leverage its features and plugins. Vite is designed to be fast and efficient, and switching to Webpack would add unnecessary complexity.

2. **Explore Vite Plugins**: Look into Vite plugins that can help you achieve similar functionality to Webpack's Module Federation. The Vite ecosystem is growing, and there are many plugins available for various use cases.

3. **Micro Frontends with Vite**: If you are specifically interested in micro frontends, research how to implement them using Vite. There are community resources and examples available that demonstrate how to achieve micro frontend architectures with Vite.

By sticking with Vite and exploring its ecosystem, you can maintain a simpler and more efficient build process without the need to introduce Webpack.

### ==tips for writing a modular codebase

A modular codebase is organized in a way that promotes separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability. Here are the key characteristics and tips for writing a modular codebase:

### Characteristics of a Modular Codebase

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Each module or component has a single responsibility and does not overlap with others.
   - Code is organized by functionality rather than by type (e.g., grouping related components, services, and utilities together).

2. **Reusability**:
   - Modules and components are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application.
   - Common functionality is abstracted into shared modules or libraries.

3. **Encapsulation**:
   - Modules encapsulate their internal details and expose only what is necessary through a well-defined interface.
   - Implementation details are hidden, reducing the risk of unintended interactions.

4. **Loose Coupling**:
   - Modules are loosely coupled, meaning they have minimal dependencies on each other.
   - Changes in one module have minimal impact on others.

5. **High Cohesion**:
   - Code within a module is highly cohesive, meaning it is closely related and works together to achieve a specific purpose.

6. **Scalability**:
   - The codebase can easily scale by adding new modules without affecting existing ones.
   - Modules can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

### Tips for Writing a Modular Codebase

1. **Organize by Feature**:
   - Group related files (components, services, utilities) by feature rather than by type.
   - Example structure:
     ```
     src/
       features/
         featureA/
           components/
           services/
           utils/
         featureB/
           components/
           services/
           utils/
       shared/
         components/
         services/
         utils/
     ```

2. **Use Clear and Consistent Naming Conventions**:
   - Use descriptive and consistent names for modules, components, and files.
   - Follow a naming convention that makes it easy to identify the purpose of each module.

3. **Abstract Common Functionality**:
   - Identify common functionality and abstract it into shared modules or libraries.
   - Example: Create a `shared` directory for common components, services, and utilities.

4. **Define Clear Interfaces**:
   - Define clear and minimal interfaces for modules to interact with each other.
   - Use TypeScript interfaces or types to enforce contracts between modules.

5. **Encapsulate Implementation Details**:
   - Hide implementation details within modules and expose only what is necessary.
   - Use private methods and properties to encapsulate internal logic.

6. **Minimize Dependencies**:
   - Minimize dependencies between modules to reduce coupling.
   - Use dependency injection or service locators to manage dependencies.

7. **Write Reusable Components**:
   - Write components that are reusable and configurable through props or parameters.
   - Avoid hardcoding values and use configuration options instead.

8. **Use Module Boundaries**:
   - Define clear boundaries for modules and avoid crossing them unnecessarily.
   - Keep related code within the same module and avoid spreading it across multiple modules.

9. **Document Your Code**:
   - Document the purpose and usage of each module and component.
   - Use comments and documentation tools to provide context and examples.

10. **Test Modules Independently**:
    - Write unit tests for each module to ensure they work independently.
    - Use mocking and stubbing to isolate modules during testing.

### Example of a Modular Codebase

Here’s an example of a modular codebase structure:

```
src/
  features/
    auth/
      components/
        LoginForm.tsx
        RegisterForm.tsx
      services/
        authService.ts
      utils/
        authHelpers.ts
    dashboard/
      components/
        Dashboard.tsx
        DashboardWidget.tsx
      services/
        dashboardService.ts
      utils/
        dashboardHelpers.ts
  shared/
    components/
      Button.tsx
      Modal.tsx
    services/
      apiService.ts
    utils/
      dateHelpers.ts
  index.tsx
  App.tsx
```

### Summary

- **Separation of Concerns**: Organize code by functionality.
- **Reusability**: Design modules and components to be reusable.
- **Encapsulation**: Hide implementation details and expose minimal interfaces.
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between modules.
- **High Cohesion**: Ensure code within a module is closely related.
- **Scalability**: Structure the codebase to easily add new modules.

By following these tips and characteristics, you can create a modular codebase that is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand.

## Explicacion de este code snippet:

```
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [
react(),
federation({
name: 'app',
filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
exposes: {
'./Button': './src/shared/components/Button',
},

remotes: {
remoteApp: 'http://localhost:5174/remoteEntry.js',
},

shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
}),
],

```

### Explanation of the Code Snippet:

#### [`filename: 'remoteEntry.js'`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition")
- **Purpose**: This specifies the name of the file that will be generated by the module federation plugin. This file will contain the metadata and the code necessary for other applications to consume the exposed modules.
- **Arbitrary**: Yes, the filename is arbitrary. You can name it anything you like, but `remoteEntry.js` is a common convention.

#### [`exposes: { './Button': './src/shared/components/Button' }`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition")
- **Purpose**: This configuration exposes the [`Button`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A11%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition") component so that it can be consumed by other applications. The key (`'./Button'`) is the name under which the component will be exposed, and the value (`'./src/shared/components/Button'`) is the path to the component in your codebase.
- **For Testing**: In this example, exposing the [`Button`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A11%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition") component is likely for demonstration or testing purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would expose the components or modules that you want to share across different applications.

#### [`remotes: { remoteApp: 'http://localhost:5174/remoteEntry.js' }`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition")
- **Purpose**: This configuration specifies the remote applications that this application can consume. The key (`'remoteApp'`) is the name under which the remote application will be referenced, and the value (`'http://localhost:5174/remoteEntry.js'`) is the URL where the remote entry file is hosted.

### When Your Codebase is Ready:

When your codebase is ready, you should update the [`exposes`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition") and [`remotes`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition") configurations to reflect the actual modules and components you want to share and consume.

#### Example Configuration for a Ready Codebase:

1. **Expose Multiple Components**:
   ```typescript
   exposes: {
     './Header': './src/components/Header',
     './Footer': './src/components/Footer',
     './Sidebar': './src/components/Sidebar',
   },
   ```

2. **Consume Multiple Remote Applications**:
   ```typescript
   remotes: {
     authApp: 'http://localhost:5175/remoteEntry.js',
     dashboardApp: 'http://localhost:5176/remoteEntry.js',
   },
   ```

### Updated [`vite.config.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_react_boilerplate/vite.config.ts") Example:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import federation from '@originjs/vite-plugin-federation';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    federation({
      name: 'mainApp',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './Header': './src/components/Header',
        './Footer': './src/components/Footer',
        './Sidebar': './src/components/Sidebar',
      },
      remotes: {
        authApp: 'http://localhost:5175/remoteEntry.js',
        dashboardApp: 'http://localhost:5176/remoteEntry.js',
      },
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
    }),
  ],
  server: {
    port: 5173,
    open: true,
    host: '0.0.0.0',
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': '/src',
    },
  },
});
```

### Key Points:

- **[`filename`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition")**: The name of the generated file containing the module federation metadata. It can be any name you choose.
- **[`exposes`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition")**: List the components or modules you want to share with other applications.
- **[`remotes`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition")**: List the remote applications you want to consume, specifying their URLs.

By configuring the [`exposes`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition") and [`remotes`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d94a949c-522b-475e-934c-b1b6791ce70e%22%5D "Go to definition") fields appropriately, you can set up a robust micro frontend architecture that allows different parts of your application to be developed and deployed independently.

### ==entonces como debería manejar la parte del remoteEntry en el early stage de este repo

Not quite. The [`remoteApp`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22cf863bfa-18d7-48da-80c8-0bceaae6d610%22%5D "Go to definition") configuration should point to the URL of the `remoteEntry.js` file generated by the remote application. This file contains the metadata and code necessary for module federation to work. It is not meant to point directly to a component file like `App.tsx`.

### Correct Configuration:

- **[`remoteApp`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22cf863bfa-18d7-48da-80c8-0bceaae6d610%22%5D "Go to definition")**: This should point to the URL where the `remoteEntry.js` file is hosted by the remote application.

### Example:

If you have a remote application running on `http://localhost:5174` and it generates a `remoteEntry.js` file, your configuration should look like this:

```typescript
remotes: {
  remoteApp: 'http://localhost:5174/remoteEntry.js',
},
```

### Steps to Set Up a Remote Application:

1. **Create a Remote Application**:
   - Set up a new Vite project for the remote application.
   - Configure it to expose the necessary components.

2. **Generate `remoteEntry.js`**:
   - Ensure the remote application is configured to generate the `remoteEntry.js` file using the `vite-plugin-federation`.

### Example Configuration for Remote Application:

**File: [`remote-app/vite.config.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22cf863bfa-18d7-48da-80c8-0bceaae6d610%22%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_react_boilerplate/vite.config.ts")**:
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import federation from '@originjs/vite-plugin-federation';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    federation({
      name: 'remoteApp',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './Button': './src/components/Button',
      },
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
    }),
  ],
  server: {
    port: 5174,
    open: true,
    host: '0.0.0.0',
  },
});
```

### Example Component in Remote Application:

**File: `remote-app/src/components/Button.tsx`**:
```typescript
import React from 'react';

const Button: React.FC = () => {
  return <button>Remote Button</button>;
};

export default Button;
```

### Main Application Configuration:

        './Header': './src/components/Header',
        './Footer': './src/components/Footer',
        './Sidebar': './src/components/Sidebar',
      },
      remotes: {

});
```

### Summary:

- **[`remoteApp`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%7D%5D%2C%22cf863bfa-18d7-48da-80c8-0bceaae6d610%22%5D "Go to definition")** should point to the URL of the `remoteEntry.js` file generated by the remote application.
- Each remote application should be configured to expose the necessary components and generate a `remoteEntry.js` file.
- The main application should consume the remote applications by referencing their `remoteEntry.js` files.

By following these steps, you can set up a micro frontend architecture where different groups of components run as separate projects and are integrated using module federation.

==Yes, you need another application (e.g., Authentication) that will expose its components via `remoteEntry.js` for the current application to consume.


## Next step:

Given your vision and requirements, the best decision is to:

1. **Leave the Template as It Is**: Ensure the template includes the necessary configuration for module federation (`remoteEntry.js`, `exposes`, `remotes`).
2. **Use the Template to Build Microfrontends**: Start new projects using this template to create individual microfrontends.
3. **Avoid Building a Monolith**: Focus on developing each microfrontend independently from the start, rather than building a monolith and splitting it later.

This approach aligns with your goal of building microfrontends from the beginning and ensures that each project can be developed and deployed independently.

___
## what about shared components:

For shared components, you have two main options:

### Option 1: Include in the Template
- **Pros**:
  - Simplifies initial setup for each microfrontend.
  - Ensures consistency across all microfrontends.
- **Cons**:
  - Any updates to shared components require updating the template and all microfrontends.

### Option 2: Create a Separate Microfrontend for Shared Components
- **Pros**:
  - Centralized management of shared components.
  - Easier to update and maintain shared components.
  - Reduces duplication and ensures consistency.
- **Cons**:
  - Adds complexity in setting up and managing dependencies.

### Recommendation:
Given your goal of building microfrontends, the best approach is to **create a separate microfrontend for shared components**. This allows you to manage and update shared components centrally, ensuring consistency and reducing duplication.

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Create a Shared Components Microfrontend**:
   - Set up a new Vite project for shared components.
   - Configure it to expose the necessary components using module federation.

2. **Expose Shared Components**:
   - Expose UI components, Header, Footer, Dashboard, Dialogs, Layout components, and string messages.

3. **Consume Shared Components in Other Microfrontends**:
   - Configure other microfrontends to consume the shared components from the shared components microfrontend.

### Example Configuration for Shared Components Microfrontend:

        './Button': './src/components/Button',
        './Header': './src/components/Header',
        './Footer': './src/components/Footer',
        './Dashboard': './src/components/Dashboard',
        './Dialog': './src/components/Dialog',
        './Layout': './src/components/Layout',
        './i18n': './src/i18n',
      },
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
    }),
  ],
  server: {
    port: 5175,
    open: true,
    host: '0.0.0.0',
  },
});
```

### Example Configuration for Consuming Microfrontend:

**File: [`another-microfrontend/vite.config.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Freactjs%2Fmyprojects%2Ftb_fe_react_boilerplate%2Fvite.config.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22120ec256-fec8-44e4-bc1f-453e3b79fbb9%22%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/reactjs/myprojects/tb_fe_react_boilerplate/vite.config.ts")**:
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import federation from '@originjs/vite-plugin-federation';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    federation({
      name: 'anotherMicrofrontend',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      remotes: {
        sharedComponents: 'http://localhost:5175/remoteEntry.js',
      },
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
    }),
  ],
  server: {
    port: 5176,
    open: true,
    host: '0.0.0.0',
  },
});
```

By following this approach, you can manage shared components centrally and ensure that all microfrontends have access to the latest versions of these components.

___
### should the first microfrontend to code is the one in charge to handle shared components?

Yes, you are correct. The first microfrontend to code should be the one that handles the shared components. This will serve as the foundation for other microfrontends to consume common UI elements, layouts, and utilities.

### Steps to Implement:

1. **Create the Shared Components Microfrontend**:
   - Set up a new Vite project for shared components.
   - Configure it to expose the necessary components using module federation.

2. **Expose Shared Components**:
   - Expose UI components, Header, Footer, Dashboard, Dialogs, Layout components, and string messages.

3. **Consume Shared Components in Other Microfrontends**:
   - Configure other microfrontends to consume the shared components from the shared components microfrontend.
