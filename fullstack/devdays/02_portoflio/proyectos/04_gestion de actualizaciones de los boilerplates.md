No, changes made to a boilerplate repository will not automatically propagate to all repositories that were created from that template. Each repository created from the template is a separate, independent repository. 

### Options to Manage Updates:

1. **Manual Updates**:
   - You can manually apply updates to each repository created from the template. This can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially if you have many repositories.

2. **Using Git Submodules**:
   - You can use Git submodules to include the boilerplate as a submodule in your projects. This way, you can update the submodule in each project to pull in changes from the boilerplate repository.

3. **Using a Monorepo**:
   - You can manage multiple projects within a single monorepo using tools like Lerna or Nx. This allows you to share code and configurations across projects more easily.

4. **Custom Scripts**:
   - You can write custom scripts to automate the process of pulling updates from the boilerplate repository and applying them to your projects.

### Example Using Git Submodules:

1. **Add Boilerplate as a Submodule**:
   - In your project repository, add the boilerplate repository as a submodule.

   ```sh
   git submodule add https://github.com/yourusername/boilerplate-repo.git boilerplate
   ```

2. **Update Submodule**:
   - When you make changes to the boilerplate repository, you can update the submodule in your project repository to pull in the latest changes.

   ```sh
   cd boilerplate
   git pull origin main
   cd ..
   git add boilerplate
   git commit -m "Update boilerplate submodule"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Summary:

- **Manual Updates**: Apply updates manually to each repository.
- **Git Submodules**: Use submodules to include the boilerplate in your projects and update it as needed.
- **Monorepo**: Manage multiple projects within a single repository.
- **Custom Scripts**: Automate the update process with custom scripts.
