# NodeTodo API Technical Data Sheet

## Project Overview
A RESTful API for a Todo application built with modern Node.js practices, featuring comprehensive testing, user authentication, and role-based access control.

## Technology Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|----------|--------------|
| **Core Runtime** | Node.js â‰¥20.11.0 |
| **Language** | TypeScript |
| **Framework** | Express.js |
| **Database** | MongoDB with Mongoose |
| **Authentication** | JWT-based auth with role-based access control |
| **Testing** | Jest with comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests |
| **API Design** | RESTful API with structured response formatting |
| **Code Quality** | ESLint, consistent error handling patterns |

## API Features

- **Todo Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete todos
- **User Management**: User authentication and authorization
- **Role Management**: Role-based access control with granular permissions
- **Health Checks**: API self-monitoring endpoints

## Architectural Highlights

- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of routes, controllers, and services
- **Path Aliasing**: Type-safe import aliases for better code organization
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E test suites
- **Environment Support**: Development and production environment configurations
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error management across the application
- **Database Seeding**: Automated data seeding for development and testing

## Design Patterns

- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation of Models (data), Controllers (request handling), and Views (response formatting)
- **Repository Pattern**: Service layer abstracts database operations from business logic
- **Dependency Injection**: Controllers receive services as dependencies for better testability
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating test mocks and configuration objects
- **Middleware Pattern**: Composable request processing pipeline for authentication, logging, and error handling
- **Singleton Pattern**: Single database connection shared across the application
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different response strategies based on HTTP status codes
- **Adapter Pattern**: Standardized response format across different API endpoints
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-based error logging and request monitoring

## Security Features
