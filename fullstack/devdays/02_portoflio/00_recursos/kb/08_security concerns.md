# Node.JS


1. First, check for vulnerabilities:
```bash
npm audit
```

2. Generate a detailed report:
```bash
npm audit --json > audit-report.json
```

3. Check outdated packages:
```bash
npm outdated
```

4. To automatically fix issues where possible:
```bash
npm audit fix
```

5. For major version updates that might have breaking changes:
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

Common critical packages to check in your project:

| Package | Current | Recommended | Reason |
|---------|----------|-------------|---------|
| jsonwebtoken | <9.0.0 | >=9.0.2 | Auth bypass vulnerabilities |
| express | <4.17.3 | >=4.18.2 | Security fixes |
| mongodb | <5.6.0 | >=5.9.0 | Connection handling fixes |
| mongoose | <7.0.3 | >=8.0.3 | Security improvements |

To update a specific package:
```bash
npm install package-name@latest
```

After updates:
1. Run your tests
2. Check for breaking changes
3. Update your TypeScript types
4. Test your API endpoints

Would you like me to help analyze your specific package.json for vulnerabilities?
