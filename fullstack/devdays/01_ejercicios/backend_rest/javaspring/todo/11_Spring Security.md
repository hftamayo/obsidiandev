==como funciona el paquete Spring Security:

Yes, looking at examples can be a great way to understand how to use Spring Security. The official Spring Security documentation is a good place to start. It provides a comprehensive guide with examples on how to use Spring Security in various scenarios.

In addition, there are many tutorials and guides available online that provide step-by-step instructions on how to set up Spring Security in a Spring Boot application. These resources often include complete code examples that you can use as a reference.

Remember, the key components of Spring Security configuration are:

1. `HttpSecurity`: This is used to configure the security restrictions for specific http paths in your application. It also allows configuring login and logout behavior, CSRF protection, session management, and more.

2. `AuthenticationManager`: This is responsible for authenticating the user. It's usually configured with an `AuthenticationProvider` which connects to your user database and checks user credentials.

3. `UserDetailsService`: This is used to load user-specific data and is used by the `AuthenticationProvider` to check credentials.

4. `PasswordEncoder`: This is used to encode and verify passwords.

5. `Filter`: Spring Security is based on Servlet Filters. You can add custom filters to the Spring Security filter chain to perform actions such as authentication and authorization.

In your case, you have already defined these components in your `AuthenticationManagerConfig` and `FilterConfig` classes. You just need to assemble them in your `SpringSecurityConfig` class. The code I provided in the previous response shows how to do this. 

Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual paths and roles. Also, ensure that your `AuthenticationTokenFilter` is correctly set up to authenticate the JWT token.

==una confusion con la AI es que a veces me sugiere codigo de Spring Security 4 y luego lo mezcla con la version 5 por eso caigo en un rabbit hole, aca una explicacion:

The error "Cannot resolve symbol 'WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter'" suggests that the class `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` is not found. This is because `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` has been deprecated and removed in Spring Security 5.

In Spring Security 5, you should extend `SecurityConfigurerAdapter` or implement `SecurityConfigurer` interface instead. However, for most use cases, you can simply remove the extension of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` and override the `configure(HttpSecurity http)` method directly in your configuration class.

Here's how you can update your `SpringSecurityConfig` class:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SpringSecurityConfig {

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

    @Autowired
    private FilterRegistrationBean<AuthenticationTokenFilter> jwtFilterRegistrationBean;

    @Autowired
    private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    @Bean
    public void configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        httpSecurity
                .csrf().disable()
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/api/user/**").hasRole("USER")
                .antMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
                .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login")
                .defaultSuccessUrl("/home")
                .and()
                .exceptionHandling()
                .authenticationEntryPoint(new HttpStatusEntryPoint(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED))
                .and()
                .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
                .and()
                .requiresChannel()
                .anyRequest()
                .requiresSecure();

        httpSecurity
                .addFilterBefore(jwtFilterRegistrationBean.getFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
                .authenticationProvider(authenticationProvider());
    }

    @Bean
    public DaoAuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider() {
        DaoAuthenticationProvider provider = new DaoAuthenticationProvider();
        provider.setHideUserNotFoundExceptions(false);
        provider.setUserDetailsService(userDetailsService());
        provider.setPasswordEncoder(passwordEncoder);
        return provider;
    }

    @Bean
    public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        return new UserDetailsServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

In this updated code, `SpringSecurityConfig` no longer extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. Instead, the `configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity)` method is defined directly in the class.

==este es otro issue, al parecer la implementación de Spring Security 5 es bien distinta a las anteriores, asi que en mi caso no debería de este approach, o al menos, no ver implementaciones que tienen a la version 4 o inferior:

The error "Method does not override method from its superclass" is likely due to the `@Override` annotation on the `configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity)` method in your `SpringSecurityConfig` class. This error occurs when the method you're trying to override does not exist in the superclass.

In Spring Security 5 and later, the `configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity)` method is not a part of any class that your `SpringSecurityConfig` class can extend. Instead, you should implement `SecurityConfigurer<DefaultSecurityFilterChain, HttpSecurity>` interface and override its `configure` method.

Here's how you can update your `SpringSecurityConfig` class:

```java
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.SecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SpringSecurityConfig extends SecurityConfigurerAdapter<DefaultSecurityFilterChain, HttpSecurity> {

    @Autowired
    private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

    @Autowired
    private FilterRegistrationBean<AuthenticationTokenFilter> jwtFilterRegistrationBean;

    @Autowired
    private PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder;

    @Override
    public void configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        httpSecurity
                .csrf().disable()
                .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()
                .antMatchers("/api/user/**").hasRole("USER")
                .antMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
                .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login")
                .defaultSuccessUrl("/home")
                .and()
                .exceptionHandling()
                .authenticationEntryPoint(new HttpStatusEntryPoint(HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED))
                .and()
                .sessionManagement().sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)
                .and()
                .requiresChannel()
                .anyRequest()
                .requiresSecure();

        httpSecurity
                .addFilterBefore(jwtFilterRegistrationBean.getFilter(), UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter.class)
                .authenticationProvider(authenticationProvider());
    }

    @Bean
    public DaoAuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider() {
        DaoAuthenticationProvider provider = new DaoAuthenticationProvider();
        provider.setHideUserNotFoundExceptions(false);
        provider.setUserDetailsService(userDetailsService());
        provider.setPasswordEncoder(passwordEncoder);
        return provider;
    }

    @Bean
    public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        return new UserDetailsServiceImpl();
    }
}
```

In this updated code, `SpringSecurityConfig` extends `SecurityConfigurerAdapter<DefaultSecurityFilterChain, HttpSecurity>` and the `configure(HttpSecurity httpSecurity)` method is correctly overridden. This should resolve the error you're seeing.

==en varios ejemplos la clase SpringSecurityConfig es bien compleja pues tiene varias responsabilidades:

==aca mi clase AuthenticationManagerConfig:

@Configuration  
public class AuthenticationManagerConfig {  
  
  
    @Autowired  
    private final UserDetailsServiceImpl userDetailsServiceImpl;  
  
    @Autowired  
    private final AuthenticationManagerBuilder authenticationManagerBuilder;  
  
    public AuthenticationManagerConfig(UserDetailsServiceImpl userDetailsServiceImpl,  
                                       AuthenticationManagerBuilder authenticationManagerBuilder) {  
        this.userDetailsServiceImpl = userDetailsServiceImpl;  
        this.authenticationManagerBuilder = authenticationManagerBuilder;  
    }  
  
    @Bean  
    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean() throws Exception {  
        authenticationManagerBuilder  
                .userDetailsService(userDetailsServiceImpl)  
                .passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());  
        return authenticationManagerBuilder.build();  
    }  
  
    @Bean  
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {  
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();  
    }  
  
}

==aca esta la opinion de la AI:

Yes, your `AuthenticationManagerConfig` class is useful. It is responsible for creating and configuring the `AuthenticationManager` bean, which is a crucial component in Spring Security's authentication process. 

The `AuthenticationManager` is responsible for validating the user credentials. In your `AuthenticationManagerConfig` class, you're setting up the `AuthenticationManager` with a `UserDetailsService` and a `PasswordEncoder`. The `UserDetailsService` loads user-specific data and is used by the `AuthenticationManager` to check user credentials, while the `PasswordEncoder` is used to encode and verify passwords.

In addition, your `AuthenticationManagerConfig` class is also providing a `PasswordEncoder` bean, which is used to encode passwords in your application.

So, your `AuthenticationManagerConfig` class is doing important work and is a necessary part of your application's security configuration.

==them why not reference it at some point of the code of SpringSecConfig class?

==The AuthenticationManager is a core component in Spring Security's authentication process. It's used by the Spring Security filter chain to authenticate requests. Even though it's not directly referenced in your SpringSecurityConfig class, it's still being used behind the scenes by Spring Security. 

==so you're saying the AuthManageConfig class will be used automatically by SpringSecConfig ?

==Yes, that's correct. The `AuthenticationManagerConfig` class is annotated with `@Configuration`, which means it's a source of bean definitions for the Spring IoC container. The `AuthenticationManager` and `PasswordEncoder` beans defined in this class will be automatically picked up by Spring's component scanning and can be autowired into other components, such as your `SpringSecurityConfig` class. 

==So, even though there's no explicit reference to `AuthenticationManagerConfig` in `SpringSecurityConfig`, the beans defined in `AuthenticationManagerConfig` are being used in `SpringSecurityConfig` via autowiring. This is part of the "convention over configuration" paradigm that Spring follows, which allows for less boilerplate and more focus on business logic.

==clase FilterConfig:

@Configuration  
public class FilterConfig {  
    @Autowired  
  
    private AuthenticationTokenFilter jwtAuthenticationTokenFilter;  
  
    @Bean  
    public FilterRegistrationBean<AuthenticationTokenFilter> jwtFilterRegistrationBean() {  
        FilterRegistrationBean<AuthenticationTokenFilter> registrationBean = new FilterRegistrationBean<>();  
        registrationBean.setFilter(jwtAuthenticationTokenFilter);  
        registrationBean.setOrder(1); // set order here  
        return registrationBean;  
    }  
  
}

==comentario de la AI:

Your `FilterConfig` class is correctly set up to create a `FilterRegistrationBean` for your `AuthenticationTokenFilter`. This bean allows you to control the ordering of the filter in the filter chain and to apply the filter to specific URL patterns.

In your `SpringSecurityConfig` class, you're autowiring a `FilterRegistrationBean<AuthenticationTokenFilter>` and adding the filter from this bean to the Spring Security filter chain. This means that the `AuthenticationTokenFilter` is being applied to all requests.

The `FilterRegistrationBean` created in your `FilterConfig` class is being used in your `SpringSecurityConfig` class via autowiring. So, your `FilterConfig` class is indeed useful and contributes to the security configuration of your application.

You don't need to instantiate the `FilterConfig` class in your `SpringSecurityConfig` class. As long as the `FilterConfig` class is in a package that's scanned by Spring (which it should be, since it's annotated with `@Configuration`), the `FilterRegistrationBean` bean it provides will be automatically picked up by Spring's component scanning and can be autowired into other components.

==cool, now that I have a clearer view, help me to debug the remaining error, te line 44 is still throwing this error "cannot resolve method antMatchers in ExpressionInterceptUIRegistry"

The error message "Cannot resolve method 'antMatchers' in 'ExpressionInterceptUrlRegistry'" suggests that the method `antMatchers` cannot be found. This is likely because the `authorizeRequests()` method does not return an object of a type that has an `antMatchers` method.

In Spring Security, the `authorizeRequests()` method returns an object of type `ExpressionInterceptUrlRegistry`, which does have an `antMatchers` method. Therefore, the error might be due to an incorrect import or a version mismatch between different parts of Spring Security.

The `antMatchers` method is used to apply HTTP security to specific URL patterns. It should be used after `authorizeRequests()`. Here is an example of how it's typically used:

```java
httpSecurity
    .authorizeRequests()
    .antMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()
    .antMatchers("/api/user/**").hasRole("USER")
    .antMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
    .anyRequest().authenticated();
```

In your case, the code seems to be correct. So, please check the following:

1. Ensure that you're importing the correct `HttpSecurity` class. It should be `org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity`.

2. Check your Spring Security version. Ensure that it's compatible with the `antMatchers` method. If you're using a very old version of Spring Security, it might not have this method.

3. If you're using an IDE, try to rebuild the project or re-import the Maven dependencies. Sometimes, the IDE might not correctly recognize the methods due to caching issues or problems with the project setup.

If the problem persists after checking these points, please provide more information about your Spring Security version and your project setup.
