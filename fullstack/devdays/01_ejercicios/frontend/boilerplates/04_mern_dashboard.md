==como gestionar el menu de opciones basado en el rol del usuario logeado por el backend:

1. After the login workflow, the backend usually sends a response to the frontend containing the user's information, including their role. This response can be used to determine which endpoints to display. The frontend can store this information in a state management system like Redux or the Context API in React. Then, based on the user's role, you can conditionally render different components or endpoints. Here's a simplified example:

```javascript
// Assuming userRole is stored in state and updated after login
const userRole = this.state.userRole;

return (
  <div>
    {userRole === 'admin' && <AdminSidebar />}
    {userRole === 'user' && <UserSidebar />}
  </div>
);
```

2. The microservice design pattern is primarily a backend architecture pattern. It involves developing separate, small services each with their own database and business logic. These services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. However, the concept of microservices can also be applied to the frontend in the form of Micro Frontends, where each frontend app is independent and can be developed and deployed separately. This is less common and has its own set of challenges and benefits.
