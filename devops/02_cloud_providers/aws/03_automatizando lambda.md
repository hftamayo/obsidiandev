    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Sid    = ""
        Principal = {
          Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
        }
      },
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "lambda_policy" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.lambda_role.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole"
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "lambdashello" {
  function_name = "lambdashello"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_role.arn
  handler       = "index.handler"
  runtime       = "nodejs20.x"
  filename      = "${path.module}/lambdashello.zip"
  source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("${path.module}/lambdashello.zip")
}

output "lambda_function_arn" {
  value = aws_lambda_function.lambdashello.arn
}
```

3. **Prepare Your Lambda Deployment Package**:
   - Ensure your TypeScript files are compiled and zipped as described earlier.
   - Place the [`lambdashello.zip`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fhftamayo%2Fsourcecode%2Fnodejs%2Fmyprojects%2Fnodelambdas101%2Flambdashello.zip%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22416ae27a-f684-416b-a513-62fe81567ffa%22%5D "/home/hftamayo/sourcecode/nodejs/myprojects/nodelambdas101/lambdashello.zip") file in the same directory as your `main.tf` file.
