==I'm trying again to setup a kubernete cluster, I found a tutorial online that requires 3 systems, one will be the master and the rest ones will be workers, that setup is thinking to build a cluster?

Yes, the setup you described is a common way to set up a Kubernetes cluster. 

In a Kubernetes cluster, one or more machines act as the control plane (master), and the rest act as worker nodes. The control plane manages the cluster and the worker nodes run the applications.

Here's a brief overview of the roles:

- **Master Node:** The master node (or control plane) is responsible for managing the state of the cluster. It schedules and deploys applications to the worker nodes. The master node contains several components, including the API server, scheduler, and etcd database.

- **Worker Nodes:** Worker nodes are the machines where your applications run. They receive tasks from the master node, such as running application containers. Each worker node runs a kubelet, which communicates with the master node, and a container runtime, which runs the containers.

In a production environment, you would typically have multiple master nodes for high availability, but for learning purposes or smaller, non-critical deployments, a single master node is sufficient.

So, if you have three systems, you could set up one as the master node and the other two as worker nodes. This would give you a small but fully functional Kubernetes cluster.

==all right, I have just one single system to install and setup a k8s cluster, what tools do you recommend me?

If you only have a single machine and want to set up a Kubernetes cluster for learning or development purposes, you can use tools like Minikube or kind. These tools create a local Kubernetes cluster on your machine using virtualization.

**Minikube:** Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.

You can install Minikube following the instructions on the [official Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

**kind (Kubernetes in Docker):** kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes". It was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

You can install kind following the instructions on the [official kind website](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

Both of these tools are great for learning Kubernetes and developing applications that will be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. They are not suitable for production use, as they only run a single node and do not have the redundancy and scalability features of a full Kubernetes cluster.

==I want to setup an on premise kubernete cluster, the idea is to run CI/CD pipelines, the desired environments should be development and production, I use Vmware as hypervisor, I have no restriction of hardware and the most important: the production environment must be high availability and resilient, please give me recommendations about the tools I should use

Setting up an on-premise Kubernetes cluster for a production environment involves several steps and tools. Here are some recommendations:

1. **Kubernetes Distribution:** For on-premise installations, you might want to consider a Kubernetes distribution that is designed for enterprise use. Examples include OpenShift (from Red Hat), Rancher, or VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid. These distributions come with additional features like integrated monitoring, logging, and often have a simpler setup process.

2. **Infrastructure Automation:** Tools like Terraform can be used to automate the provisioning of your VMware infrastructure. This can help ensure consistency across your environments and make it easier to manage your infrastructure.

3. **Configuration Management:** Tools like Ansible can be used to automate the configuration of your Kubernetes nodes. This can help ensure that all nodes are configured consistently and can make it easier to manage your cluster.

4. **Networking:** You will need a network plugin for Kubernetes. Calico and Flannel are popular choices. Your choice of network plugin may depend on your specific networking requirements.

5. **Storage:** Consider how you will handle persistent storage in your cluster. You might use a local storage solution, or you could use a storage solution that is integrated with VMware.

6. **High Availability:** For high availability, you will want to have multiple master nodes in your cluster. This can be achieved using the `kubeadm` tool, which supports creating highly available clusters.

7. **Monitoring and Logging:** Consider using a tool like Prometheus for monitoring and Grafana for visualization. For logging, you might consider a stack like EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana) or Loki.

8. **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI, and ArgoCD are popular choices for CI/CD in a Kubernetes environment. Your choice might depend on your specific requirements and what you're already familiar with.

9. **Ingress:** You will likely need an ingress controller to manage access to your applications. Nginx and Traefik are popular choices.

10. **Backup:** Don't forget about backups. Tools like Velero can help with backing up your Kubernetes cluster.

Remember, setting up a production-grade Kubernetes cluster involves a lot of considerations and can be complex. It's important to plan carefully and test thoroughly.
