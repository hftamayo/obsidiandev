If you want to switch to ECMAScript modules (ESM), you can do so by changing the `module` option in your `tsconfig.json` file to `ESNext` or `ES2020`. This tells TypeScript to output ECMAScript modules.

However, there are a few things to consider:

1. **Node.js Support**: Node.js has full support for ECMAScript modules as of version 14. If you're using an older version of Node.js, you might need to upgrade.

2. **File Extensions**: Node.js treats JavaScript files as CommonJS modules by default. To tell Node.js to treat your files as ECMAScript modules, you can either:
   - Change the file extension from `.js` to `.mjs`.
   - Add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`. This tells Node.js to treat all `.js` files in your project as ECMAScript modules.

3. **Importing CommonJS Modules**: If you're importing a CommonJS module in your ECMAScript module, you'll need to use the `default` import syntax. For example, `import express from 'express'` instead of `import * as express from 'express'`.

4. **Running Your Code**: To run your ECMAScript modules, you can use `node --experimental-modules server.mjs` (or `server.js` if you added `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`).

Here's what your `tsconfig.json` might look like after making these changes:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

Remember, these are general guidelines and might need to be adjusted based on your specific project setup.

==cambios requeridos para jest:==

To configure Jest to work with ECMAScript modules (ESM), you need to do the following:

1. **Install Babel and the necessary plugins**: Babel is a tool that is used to compile ECMAScript 6+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines. You can install it and the necessary plugins with the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-jest
```

2. **Create a Babel configuration file**: Create a `.babelrc` file in your project root and add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "node": "current"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

This tells Babel to compile your code for the current version of Node.js.

3. **Update Jest configuration**: Update your `jest.config.js` file to use Babel:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.jsx?$': 'babel-jest',
  },
  testEnvironment: 'node',
};
```

This tells Jest to use Babel to transform your JavaScript files before running the tests.

4. **Update your package.json**: Change the `type` field in your `package.json` from `commonjs` to `module`. This tells Node.js to treat `.js` files as ECMAScript modules.

```json
"type": "module",
```

5. **Update your test scripts**: Update your test scripts in your `package.json` to use Jest. For example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest"
}
```

Now, Jest should be able to work with ECMAScript modules in your project.
